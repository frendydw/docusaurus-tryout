## What is Microservices?

Microservice architecture – a variant of the service-oriented architecture structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

## Differences Between Monolithic Architecture and Microservices Architecture

A monolithic architecture is built as one large system and is usually one code-base. A monolith is often deployed all at once, both front and end code together, regardless of what was changed. A microservices architecture however is where an app is built as a suite of small services, each with their own code-base.

## Why we use Microservices Architecture?

Microservices also allows you to optimize resources. With microservices, multiple teams work on independent services, enabling you to deploy more quickly and pivot more easily when you need to. Development time is reduced, and your teams' code will be more reusable.
